1. Run the python script to get the flag. Make sure the ```message.txt``` file is located correctly in ```files``` folder as the script expects, otherwise the ```open``` command in the script should be modified

```python3 findflaginprintedresults.py```

2. I know the output of this script looks ugly, but among these strange looking lines the real flag can be found.
