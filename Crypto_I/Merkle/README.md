We've heard plenty about Alice and Bob, but now we're going to play the role of Eve! Eve plays the role of the eavesdropper and intercepts all communication between Alice and Bob.

Given all the parameters in eve.txt compute Alice and Bob's shared secret key. The variable names are the same as the common variable names found in the previous link. The flag is in the format sigpwny{16 most significant digits of the secret key}.

Fun Fact: Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie–Hellman–Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Wikipedia)
